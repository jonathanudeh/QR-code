## What I learnt
This was my first time working with css grid, but with the help of some online resources like MDN, W3School and some medium and dev community blog post I was able to graspp the basic concept and finish this project. 

## Continued development
I will be using more of css grid layout as well as flexbox so as to get really familiar to them both although my flexbox skills are a lot smoother than that of my grid skill.
